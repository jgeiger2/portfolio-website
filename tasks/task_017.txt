# Task ID: 17
# Title: Integrate Google reCAPTCHA v2 in Contact Form (Production)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Google reCAPTCHA v2 in the contact form by registering for production keys, updating frontend integration, and adding backend server-side verification to prevent spam submissions.
# Details:
Begin by registering the site with Google reCAPTCHA v2 at the Google reCAPTCHA admin console, ensuring the correct domain is specified. Replace the existing test site key and secret key in the frontend and backend with the new production keys. On the frontend, ensure the reCAPTCHA widget is rendered using the official JavaScript resource and the correct site key. On form submission, send the reCAPTCHA response token to the backend along with the form data. On the backend, implement server-side verification by sending a POST request to Google's reCAPTCHA API endpoint with the secret key and the user's response token. Only process the form submission if the verification is successful; otherwise, return an appropriate error to the user. Ensure error handling and logging are in place for failed verifications. Update documentation to reflect the new integration steps and keys. Coordinate with Task 7 to ensure the contact form is fully functional with validation and submission logic integrated with reCAPTCHA.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the reCAPTCHA widget displays correctly on the contact form using the production site key. Submit the form with valid and invalid reCAPTCHA responses and confirm that only valid responses are accepted and processed. Attempt automated and scripted submissions to ensure spam is blocked. Check backend logs for proper error handling and that failed verifications do not result in form processing. Confirm that the frontend and backend use the production keys and that no test keys remain in the codebase. Review documentation updates for accuracy and completeness.
