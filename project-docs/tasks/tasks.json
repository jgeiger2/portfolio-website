Ensure all content is accessible and readable by following glassmorphism best practices—maintain sufficient contrast, avoid overly busy backgrounds, and use appropriate layering for depth and clarity. Integrate a 'Download as PDF' feature that exports the current resume content in a well-formatted, print-ready PDF, preserving the visual style as much as possible.

On form submission, send the reCAPTCHA response token to the backend along with the form data. On the backend, implement server-side verification by sending a POST request to Google's reCAPTCHA API endpoint with the secret key and the user's response token. Only process the form submission if the verification is successful; otherwise, return an appropriate error to the user. Ensure error handling and logging are in place for failed verifications. Update documentation to reflect the new integration steps and keys.
